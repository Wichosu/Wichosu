My biggest motivation right now is to build projects based on personal ideas, in other words I want to build things for fun, sites that will offer something based on an idea that I had. I started with www.baulchino.com in early 2025 and hope to build more sites. Here's a list (that hopefully will grow in the near future) of my sites and how they do:

- baulchino (www.baulchino.com)
  - A website to help people learn Chinese Mandarin offering popular resourses and tools. Currently around 15k+ visits per month. Soon I'll publish public analytics.
  - Check the repo baulchino for more information or just contact me via LinkedIn.
